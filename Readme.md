## Introduction

API misuses are the incorrect usages that violate the usage constraints of the API elements. API misuses could cause several issues ranging from run-time errors and exceptions, program crashes, to security vulnerabilities. The state-of-the-art mining-based approaches suffer low accuracy because they cannot differentiate infrequent from invalid usage. This is an inherent issue with the mining approaches because they need to set a pre-defined threshold for frequent API usage patterns. Another issue is that they mine a pattern and then report instances of alternative usages as violations. This paper introduces a learning-based approach for API misuse detection that avoids the need for pre-defined thresholds. To overcome the lack of training data, we designed a new data augmentation technique to apply to a graph-based representation of API usages. We also leverage Labeled, Graph-based Convolutional Network to learn the embeddings for API usages, which capture the key features in API usages and are used for API misuse detection. Our empirical evaluation on a real-world API misuse benchmark shows that our model relatively improves over the state-of-the-art API misuse detection techniques from 1.52Xâ€“11.51X in F-score.
